# EEPROM-with-the-Arduino

**Abstract**

In our Arduino project, we leverage the EEPROM to display digital values using an ADC convertor (potentiometer).
It provides persistent memory storage for user-defined settings and preferences.
Write and read operations can be performed on the EEPROM to store and retrieve data as needed for our application.
 This seamless integration simplifies data management and ensures that essential calibration data and user configurations are retained, even when the power is disconnected, enhancing the overall versatility and reliability of our project.

**Objective**

The project aims to utilize the potentiometer as an intuitive input device, allowing users to interact with the system smoothly. 
By leveraging the ADC, we can obtain precise and accurate digital representations of the analog readings, enabling further processing and control within the Arduino. 
Storing this data in the EEPROM ensures data persistence, allowing critical settings and preferences to be retained even after power cycles. 
With a focus on simplicity and modularity, the project will provide an abstraction layer, streamlining development and encouraging broader application of this analog-to-digital conversion and EEPROM usage in Arduino projects.

**Methodologies**

_**STEP 1:**_ Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.

_**STEP 2:**_ Using Arduino IDE implement the entire code. Verify the code completely and compile it. Once compiled, itâ€™s time to upload the code it Arduino board. 

_**STEP 3:**_ After uploading the code open serial monitor and set the Baud rate as 9600 and select Autoscroll.

_**STEP  4:**_ Now the output will be displayed for each adjustment given in the potentiometer.
